You are an advanced full-stack developer tasked with building a complete **AI-powered gamified learning web app** called **EduVerse**. The goal is to make an engaging, adaptive, and intelligent education platform for students, combining AI tutoring, gamification, and personalized analytics.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Tech Stack**

   * Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
   * Backend: FastAPI (Python)
   * Database: PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy)
   * Authentication: Email/Password & Google OAuth
   * AI APIs: Gemini + OpenAI integration (use `.env` for keys)
   * Hosting-ready structure for Replit (frontend + backend folders)

2. **Main Features**

   * AI-powered tutoring assistant that answers questions interactively.
   * Course & Quiz Management:

     * Users can browse, enroll in, and complete courses.
     * Each topic has quizzes that adapt in difficulty:

       * Correct answers → progressively harder questions.
       * Incorrect answers → easier, reinforcing questions.
       * Use AI to dynamically generate or adjust quiz questions.
   * Personalized Dashboard with analytics:

     * Track progress, accuracy, time spent, and weak areas.
     * Show adaptive recommendations for improvement.
   * Gamification:

     * XP points, badges, streaks, level progression.
     * Leaderboard with rankings among peers.
   * AI-driven Resource Recommendations:

     * Suggest learning materials (videos, PDFs, notes) based on weaknesses.
   * Educator Mode:

     * Teachers can upload or manage courses and quizzes.
   * Community Page:

     * Users can share progress, tips, and challenges.

3. **System Design**

   * `frontend/` → React app (with Tailwind)
   * `backend/` → FastAPI app with modular routes:

     * `/api/users`, `/api/courses`, `/api/quizzes`, `/api/ai`, `/api/analytics`
   * Use JWT authentication and role-based access (student/teacher/admin).
   * `.env` → `DATABASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`
   * Include Dockerfile for optional containerization.

4. **UI Design**

   * Clean, futuristic, gamified interface with a cosmic “EduVerse” theme.
   * Dashboard should feature progress rings, animated badges, and dynamic cards.
   * Responsive for both desktop and mobile.

5. **Extra Innovation**

   * Add an “AI Mentor” avatar (Gemini API) that interacts with students in natural dialogue.
   * Add a “Challenge Mode” where students can compete in timed AI-generated quizzes.
   * Include motivational elements: confetti, sounds, streak reminders.

**Deliverables**

* A fully functional app with:

  * Backend running on FastAPI (port 8000)
  * Frontend running on React (port 3000)
* Auto-link the two using CORS.
* Initialize git repo and README with project setup instructions.

Make it **unique, polished, and production-ready**, as if being submitted for a top-tier university or startup pitch competition.
